# Capston-Project-820
## Home Loan Approval Prediction Project
# Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting home loan approvals by considering various factors beyond traditional credit scores.

# Project Stages
Literature Review

Review factors influencing loan approvals and machine learning applications.
Data Collection

Dataset from Kaggle with 614 loan application records.
Attributes: demographics, financial details, loan-specific attributes.
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate and bivariate analyses to understand data distribution and relationships.
Feature Engineering

Create new features to enhance predictive power.
Model Selection and Training

Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees.
Evaluation: K-fold cross-validation, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
Model Evaluation and Optimization

Evaluate and optimize models, implement bias mitigation techniques.
Conclusion

Summarize findings and discuss future improvements.
