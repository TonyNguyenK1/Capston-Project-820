# Home Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting home loan approvals by considering various factors beyond traditional credit scores.

The project is divided into several stages: Literature Review, where we review factors influencing loan approvals and machine learning applications; Data Collection, where we gather a dataset from Kaggle containing 614 loan application records with various attributes such as demographics, financial details, and loan-specific attributes; Data Preprocessing, where we handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we perform univariate and bivariate analyses to understand data distribution and relationships; Feature Engineering, where we create new features to enhance predictive power; Model Selection and Training, where we train models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees, and evaluate them using K-fold cross-validation, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics; Model Evaluation and Optimization, where we evaluate and optimize the models and implement bias mitigation techniques; and Conclusion, where we summarize our findings and discuss future improvements.

The repository contains the following directories: datasets/ for the dataset, codes/ for Jupyter notebooks detailing the project workflow, and reports/ for analysis and visualizations.

To get started, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher and the required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter). Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/TonyNguyenK1/Capston-Project-820.git, navigate into the directory .
